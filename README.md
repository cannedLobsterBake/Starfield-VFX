# Starfield-VFX
Starfield (or some may call it hyperspace or warp speed) visual effect coded in Processing 3.5.2.

Speed, quantity, canvas size can all be changed within the code.

The visual effect consists of circles ementating from the center that speed up as it gets closer to the boundaries of the canvas. It resets to a random point on the canvas once it hits the edge. There is also a line that trails the circle which gets longer when both the speed increases and it gets closer to the edge.
